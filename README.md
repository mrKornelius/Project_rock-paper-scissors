# Project_rock-paper-scissors
This is the first JavaScript project I do for The Project Odin.

In first iteration it's just played against the computer in the console, so no UI is created.

In second iteration I added a simple user interface. Had to rework and rewrite most of the original code from first iteration to get it to work properly.
I'm not 100% satisfied with the global variables for the scores, but I will try to fix that at a later time.
